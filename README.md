# MusicPlaylistManager

The Music Playlist Manager project is a command-line application that focuses on the underlying data structures and algorithms for managing music playlists. Itâ€™s primary application lies in demonstrating how to efficiently handle and manipulate collections of music tracks using programming concepts.
In this project, users can perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for songs within a playlist. The implementation leverages data structures like arrays or linked lists to store track information, enabling efficient data manipulation and retrieval. By utilizing algorithms for sorting and searching, the application can quickly organize playlists by different criteria, such as artist, genre, or song title.
Additionally, the project serves as a practical exercise in applying concepts from data structures and algorithms, reinforcing the understanding of how these principles can be used to solve real-world problems. Although it lacks a graphical user interface, the command-line interface allows for straightforward interaction, showcasing the core functionality of a music playlist manager in a simplified form.
